# ShapeWorld: After Origins second beta release!
Hello!, I'm here to publish the second beta of my new game ShapeWorld: After Origins. Also this will be the last beta of the game because the game is mostly stable and I haven't found any critical bug.

This game is planned to be published in: itch.io, GameJolt, Microsoft Store and Google Play. So if you want to try the final game you can find it in those stores.

If you want to know the exact release dates please check my Twitter ([@ElCosmoXD](https://twitter.com/ElCosmoXD) or [@PixelBarrels](https://twitter.com/PixelBarrels)), I'll be publishing some information about the releases soon.

# Changes
Mostly, I fixed many bugs since the first beta release so this release is even more stable but there's no new content.

# Known problems
