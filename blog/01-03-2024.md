# The sequel to ShapeWorld: After Origins!?

Hi!, It has been a bit more than a year since the last post... sorry about it, when I made this little blog to show what I am doing, I never expected this to take so much time to write a single article and also I have been pretty busy with my life and developing the new game that we're going to talk about today.

# ShapeWorld: FightLand

Back then in 2019, I came across the idea of making a fight game (similar to Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat) with simple characters like Squares, Circles and so on which would put an end to the ShapeWorld story (yes, the same year that ShapeWorld started, it already had defined its end), after doing a pretty basic prototype, I gave up since I didn't know how to make a fight game, so the idea of making the game that finishes the ShapeWorld story was there.

Three years later (back then in 2022), I wanted to try making this game using Godot and Rust, it was also a fight game but with an online multiplayer, this was a pretty big oportunity for me to learn how networking works and how to make multiplayer games, after some months developing this, I just got an ugly prototype that worked in multiple platforms but this prototype was discarded after a few months since I ran out of inspiration to keep developing it (also I felt a bit limited by the engine...).

The last year, I made my last try using Godot 4 (again) and C++, it was a 2.5D game but it was not too different from ShapeWorld: After Origins and it had so many bugs with the physics (this was my fault...) and also, the C++ / GDExtension workflow is pretty awful, defining classes take so much time and its pretty frustrating when you have to do it multiple times per day, so I discarted this prototype.

After discarting that prototype, I gave up with the idea of making a 2.5D game, so I went back to 2D. The new prototype was pretty different from the others, instead of beign a fight game, this was a simple local multiplayer game in which the players had to fight enemies and solve simple puzzles to get out of a "prison", but after an accident with the prototype, the prototype got deleted from my disk (and no, I wasn't using git since I believed that it was going to be a simple protype), so I lost everything.

By the end of 2023 (in december), I was totally out of inspiration (due to the unfinished 4th prototype of ShapeWorld: FightLand), so I decided that I was going to put an end to all the ShapeWorld games by making ShapeWorld: FightLand.

# Now

### State
The current game is not a prototype anymore, the current state of the game is an Alpha with the main features of this new game. This game is made with Unity and follows the style of ShapeWorld: After Origins but the style is even more "minimal" and animated than before.

### Player customization
In this new game, you can customize the color of your player as you wish but this only can be made once in the game, if you want to change it later, you will have to buy a color changer in the In-Game store (don't worry, you have to pay with the money of the game).

### Store
The new store system is way more different than the one in ShapeWorld: After Origins. In order to use this store, you have to find a seller in the map and if you have the enough money to buy the item you want (you get the money by defeating enemies), you will get your desired items in the inventory.

### Gameplay
To play this game, the core of the movement is just the same as in ShapeWorld: After Origins but this game isn't separated by levels, so in order to move forward in your adventure, you will have to explore the map and see what the people of ShapeWorld have to show.

### The story
The story of this new game continues the ShapeWorld storyline, but in this game you will play as a Square that was assigned to a recognition team and you have to explore ShapeWorld to know how and when the other species will attack.

## Release date
I am not sure when this game will be exactly released since I am pretty busy in this year, but I expect that the Early Access of this game will be available in March or April of this year! so please stay tuned to see and explore ShapeWorld: FightLand from the first day! The Early Access of this game will feature only the FIRST zone / region of the game, the remaining regions will be released in new updates of the game.

There will be a free playable demo for browsers and for people that wants to try this game, but I expect that the game will come out at 1 USD, the reason of not making this game free is because I want to improve this game with the money recieved from it, I want to make this game even more alive with lots of content to play, so if I manage to sold many units the game will improve even more (and if it doesn't, it doesn't matter, I will continue developing this anyways).
