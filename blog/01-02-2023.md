# Creating a game launcher

Hello, Today I'm here to talk about how I developed the launcher for my game [ShapeWorld: After Origins](https://pixel-barrels.itch.io/shapeworld-after-origins) using only Godot with it's built-in language (GDScript).

Everything started when I wanted to make my games easy to update, so my first thought was the Hoyoverse launcher used in Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd, etc because it is really easy to use and it updates the game, shows the latest news about the game and it keeps updated.

To start with the project, the first thing that I thought was on using just Rust and a library to create a UI, but then I thought that it was too complicated to make and it could take some weeks to finish, so I used the easiest and fastest solution that I thought, use Godot to create the launcher.

First I started obviously creating the project :)

When I just created the project, I enabled a mode called `Low Processor Mode` because it basically doesn't re-draw the screen if nothing changes visually so it saves memory, CPU usage, etc.

Then I added support to open the game using the executable provided in a JSON file that I will explain later.

After that I thought that would be great if I make a launcher that can be generated with just a Python script so I wrote a script to don't have to rewrite or update multiple launchers. The script isn't too complex, it justs creates a JSON file with the game data.

I use the data inside this JSON to search the game updates, version, etc inside the server (Actually the "server" is just the github repo where this website is hosted), when I recieve the latest version in the game, I compare the internal version of the game and check if it is the latest.

If the current version is old, it will start the update process, it isn't like something too complex or anything, it justs shows a progress bar indicating how is the download going.

After the download is complete, It will start extracting the zip file with the update, Honestly this was the most annoying part of creating this launcher because I had many problems with the `ZipReader` class and creating the update file.

If the extraction was successfull, the launcher will allow you to play normally.


Obviously this didn't end here, because I want to add new features to the launchers so after publishing the first version of the launchers, I started creating an updater for the launcher. I've made this "updater" with Rust because I didn't want something too fancy for just updating the launcher, so I just created a console application that downloads the latest launcher when a new version has been detected and updates it.

There's a lot that I wanted to tell, like the porting from C# to GDScript, updating the background image and so on, but I don't want to make this blog even more boring to read so I will just stop here.

You will see this launcher when the 1.2.0 update of [ShapeWorld: After Origins](https://pixel-barrels.itch.io/shapeworld-after-origins) comes out. So, this was everything for today, thanks for reading :)
