# Translating games
Hello, currently I'm working on my next game: "ShapeWorld: After Origins" this game is the sequel of [ShapeWorld: Origins](https://pixel-barrels.itch.io/shapeworld-origins) and talks about the time when the "cube" arrived at the planet earth.

But we aren't here to talk about the game, We're here to talk about translating games and how this game is translated. Translating games is an important part of the development of a game because it could determine your target audience or it just makes the game more comfortable to play for the player.

# How do I translate my new game?
There are many ways in which you can translate a game, in [ShapeWorld: Origins](https://pixel-barrels.itch.io/shapeworld-origins) stupidly I putted the translations into a class that I write into a file from the code (Literally, I created a file with the translations from the code everytime the game starts and then I opened the file when I wanted to get a translation).

For avoiding that scenario, In "ShapeWorld: After Origins" I'm using files to manage the translations, The files with the translations are located in a foder called "Resources" for allowing the access to that folder from the code.

For reading these files I've created a class with the fields that contains the translations and a public function that loads the translation depending on the desired language.

I think that this method is pretty good because this method isn't too redundant like the method that I used in "ShapeWorld: Origins" and it just loads the translations when I need, Also if I'm right all the memory that is allocated when I load a translation is deallocated when I don't use the variable anymore due to the CSharp's garbaje collector.

Well, That's enough for today, If you have any question or suggestion just contact me via Twitter [@elcosmoxd](https://twitter.com/ElCosmoXD). I really liked this format for explaining how I implement an aspect of my games so I think that I'll write some other publications.
