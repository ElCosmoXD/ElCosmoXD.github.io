# ShapeWorld: After Origins, first launch!

Hello! after so long we’re finally here again. As a little summary I released this game: “ShapeWorld: After Origins” as a little project because the development of ShapeWorld: FightLand was pretty tough and I was tired of it, so as a solution I created this game.

In this game, you will see what happened after the first game [ShapeWorld: Origins](https://pixel-barrels.itch.io/shapeworld-origins) so there’s nothing too specific to say.

In the future, I want to add new histories, characters and more content to the game in a “monthly” format (So, the next update for this game should be in november/2022).

Thanks for reading, I’ll try to keep an schedule for the updates with the new content so please, look forward to it! Bye!

The development of ShapeWorld: FightLand will be restarted.
