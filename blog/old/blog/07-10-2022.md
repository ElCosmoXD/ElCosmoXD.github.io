# ShapeWorld: After Origins first beta release!

Hello there!, I'm here to show you the first beta release of my new game "ShapeWorld: After Origins".

This beta release only haves **2** levels because this release is just for testing, Also you don't have access to the settings menu because I want to have feedback of the game without changing any setting.

With that said, I hope you enjoy those 2 levels and if you find any bug or you have any suggestion please contact me on Twitter [@elcosmoxd](https://twitter.com/ElCosmoXD).

# Differences from the final version

In the final version you can play 5 different levels, Obviously in the future if this game is well recieved on the stores I'll consider making more levels. Also you will have access to the missing menus.

# Known problems

- When the pause menu is triggered will cause a "NullReferenceException"

# Downloads
