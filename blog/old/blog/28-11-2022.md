# What's next?

In the last article, I said that I will publish montly updates but now that I think, that is not possible, I'm pretty tired of developing games and I want to take a little rest, Also I want to start making the last game of the ShapeWorld series, ShapeWorld: FightLand. But this doesn't mean that I will stop updating ShapeWorld: After Origins, is just that I will publish updates less frecuency.

So... Thanks for reading! See you later!
