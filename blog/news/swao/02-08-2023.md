# New Update released! The version 1.4.0!

Hello!, It's been a while since the last game update, but here we are again! This update is actually the last update in which I will include a new story and also, It's the end of all the additional stories... So, let's see all the features that this update haves!

# New story: The Squares

The Squares story, is the final part of the original story of this game, in which, The Square will have to fight against every enemy in this game in order to get the divine stones.

This story contains 10 unique levels, in which, you are able to **shoot** and jump! Also, there's a new boss type that you will find in the end of the story ;)

# New feature: The Weekly Levels

Previously in other devlogs, I said that I wanted to keep this game with a sensation of "updated" and "not dead" game, so, I created a system in which I will add a new level by every level!

# New updates to the store!

Well, I will try to add more content in the store, but for now, enjoy the new blue skins!

# Future of the game

Since this is the last update with a story, the game story will no longer continue. But this doesn't end here because I have even more plans to keep this game fresh, the only thing is that I am working on other projects and in the next ShapeWorld game... so the time to develop this game will be less.

Here, take a look to my future plans and concepts to this game:

* Level editor: With the level editor, you will be able to create custom levels, with unique scenarios and enemies!
* New game selector: Since only hitting the "Play" button is kinda confusing, I will add a new menu in which the player will be able to switch between the multiple game modes like the Weekly Levels, Story Levels and the Level Editor.
* Share custom levels: With this feature, you will be able to play and share levels created by your friends throughout the local network. In the future, I'd like to add the support to share the levels without needing to be in the same internet connection, but the servers are really expensive, so I will try to find a workaround for this ;)
* New Arena mode: In this mode, you will be able to fight against all the game bosses, and get a reward for that.
* A multiplayer mode?: Since I have to do a massive refactoring in the game code, this feature will take really long time to even see the light, Also I don't think that it will be able in the next update (2.0.0) or if I will be even able to add this.
* A new store: The actual store depends on the current game version to be updated, so I want to add a new store that updates itself throughout the network.
* A new platform: For now, I have plans to start working on a Nintendo Switch version of this game. I can't say too much about this, but if I manage to do something you will be notified on my twitter account [@ElCosmoXD](https://twitter.com/ElCosmoXD).

Well, I know that this isn't too much for the future of the game, but I will be adding more things to this list since I want to keep this as an alive project.

# Thanks!

Thanks to reach the end of the article! This game will keep updating itself with the weekly levels and new features are coming, so please look forward to it. Thanks!
