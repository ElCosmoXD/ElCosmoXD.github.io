# New browser builds!

Hello!, With the 1.3.1 patch a new platform has been added. This platform is the web version of the game, this build should be totally stable for playing the entire game but as I am testing this, I can't give any warranties that everything will work properly.

The main advantage of this build is that every device that supports a browser and WebGL 2 should be able to run the game. Also, this version has support for mobile devices and should work on Apple devices as well.

# 1.3.1 Patch

The 1.3.1 patch doesn't have any big change, there are only small/minor fixes in this patch.

Thanks for reading!
