# Introducing the new 1.4.0 update!

Hello!, After months of development I'm finally ready to announce this update and what will be available after this update is released.

# The final of the additional stories

Well, this is a bit sad for me, since I really liked this additional stories. This story (The Squares story... Again) will have 10 levels, In which you will find all the enemies from the previous modes (Yes, EVERY enemy). Also, this story will have 2 phases (Day and... you will have to play to discover the other one, hehe).

# The weekly levels

Since I started the development of this game, I always wanted to keep this game with a sensation of a "live" game, but making an update with new levels every week is pretty hard because it consumes too much time to make a build for every platform at least 1 time per week. After some research, I managed to add this feature by downloading the levels from the server, so, to add a new level I just have to create the level, and update it to the server (Too easy, isn't it?).

(As you can see, this menu is in development!)

This feature will be available after the release of this update so, wait for it! ;)

# A new menu?

The new menu will put every game mode in a single menu, but I think that this won't be available until the 1.4.1 update releases...

Here goes the image of the new menu... but I don't have anything to show at this time so... Wait for it :)

# Other minimal changes

This update has many features but here are the other changes made to the game:

* Fixed the bug with the keys
* Added particles for all the enemies

# Release date...

I can't say an specific release date because there's a lot of things to do, but this update could be released on 15 of July (2023) or even before! If you wanna keep informed of the update progress, please follow my Twitter accounts [@ElCosmoXD](https://twitter.com/ElCosmoXD) and  [@PixelBarrels](https://twitter.com/PixelBarrels).

So... yes, this is the new update for ShapeWorld: After Origins. when the update releases, I will post an entire article (again) showing the latest changes of the games, so please look forward to it. Thanks for reading!
