# A new version is coming!?
Hi!, It's been a while since the last announcement for ShapeWorld: After Origins, in this time we're introducing to you the 2.0.0 version of ShapeWorld: After Origins.

This new version will be the **last** big update for this game, after this update, the game will only recieve patches or minimal changes, so let's see what is new in this new update:

* Introducing the Level Editor
* Fixed issues with the resolution across multiple devices
* An "Arena" mode
* Other minimal changes that don't need explanation :)

## The Level Editor
Since many months the level editor has been the feature that I wanted to add the most, so after 2 months developing it, I finally managed to get it into a stable state. This editor allows you to create your own levels based on every story in ShapeWorld: After Origins.

## Arena mode
The arena mode is not ready yet, but it will basically allow you to fight against the bosses in the story after you finished the additional stories, obviously you won't just fight the bosses, you will also get points when you defeat them (so yes, this is a very good way to farm money).

# The future of ShapeWorld: After Origins
The 2.0.0 update will come out as soon as the update is ready, so keep an eye to my social media acoounts to be the firsts testing this new update. Obviously everything that I talked about in this post isn't everything that the update will have, I have more changes in mind and many fixes, so the next post with the final announcement of this update will have every feature that this new update has.

Regarding the future of this game, after this update I want to make small changes only (since I think that this game is pretty good enough and I can't think on anything to expand it more), so I think that I will be creating new Weekly Levels (yes, I only made two levels and then I gave up...) and skins for the store, also, some months ago I have been considerating the posibility of a port to Nintendo Switch but the soon as I can start with it may be in June so there won't be a port soon.
