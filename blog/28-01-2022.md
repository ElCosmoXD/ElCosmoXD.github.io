# Hello!

Hello, This is the new version of my website, Here I will show you some things related to the development of my games and other topics related to software/game dev.

This website relies on a new system to publish new blog entries, so this is even more easier to me than before :D

The new system reads the desired blog entry from the url (In this case the URL is `blog.html?blog=28-01-2022.md`) and then parses the markdown file (basically the post) and puts it into an HTML page (the blog). I think that this method is pretty simple and easy to use but I'm sure that if you want to search for a specific post using a browser you won't find nothing because the browsers like Google, Duckduckgo, Bing, etc (as far as I know) they aren't able to create the required query to find the posts... But it's fine, just search the posts from the index page :)

This is everything for today, as I said before I will publish new posts soon, also I have to talk about the new ShapeWorld: After Origins update, so please look forward to it.
